# MCP Architecture Overview

The Multi-Agent MCP System follows a hub-and-spoke architecture where specialized services communicate through a central orchestrator.

## Key Components

1. **Central Orchestrator (00_master_mcp)**: Routes requests to appropriate services
2. **Specialized Services**: Each service handles specific domains
3. **Shared Network**: All services connect via Docker network

## Design Principles

- Modularity: Each service is independent
- Scalability: Services can be scaled individually
- Security: Least privilege access per service
