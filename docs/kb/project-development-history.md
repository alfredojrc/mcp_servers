# MCP Servers Project - Development History

## Project Overview

This is a multi-agent MCP (Model Context Protocol) system implementing a hub-and-spoke architecture where specialized services run in Docker containers on a shared network, orchestrated by a central master MCP server.

## Development Timeline

### Initial Development (April 2025)
- **April 3, 2025**: Project initiated by user "alf"
  - First commit: Basic project structure
  - Initial refactoring for performance improvements

### Infrastructure Phase (April 19, 2025)
- **Kubernetes Integration**: Refactored K8s MCP services, renamed services, updated ports
- **Secrets Management**: Added dedicated secrets service (port 8013)
- **Monitoring Stack**: Integrated Prometheus, Grafana, and Loki for observability
- **Port Standardization**: Updated all services to use 8000-series ports

### Enhancement Phase (April 20 - May 10, 2025)
- **April 20**: Major MCP host improvements
  - Added fastmcp library integration
  - Enhanced logging and middleware
  - Implemented new tool functions
  - Detailed test suite instructions

- **May 10**: Security and logging enhancements
  - KeePass database integration for secrets
  - Enhanced startup logging across services
  - Simplified test client connections

### Feature Expansion (May 16 - May 26, 2025)
- **May 16**: Documentation improvements
  - Major README refactoring
  - Added project structure section
  - Improved content organization

- **May 26**: Service additions and fixes
  - **New Services Added**:
    - Aider MCP (port 8014) - AI coding assistant
    - Freqtrade MCP (port 8015) - Trading bot integration
    - AI Models MCP (port 8016) - LLM gateway
  - **Improvements**:
    - Environment variable support for dynamic ports
    - JSON logging implementation
    - Health check endpoints
    - SSH command execution enhancements
    - TA-Lib installation fixes for Freqtrade

## Current State (As of January 6, 2025)

### Active Development
- System has been running for 6 days
- Core services operational (Master, Linux CLI, CMDB, Secrets)
- Several services experiencing startup issues (Freqtrade, AI Models, K8s)
- 8 services missing implementations (only README files)

### Architecture Achievements
1. **Centralized Orchestration**: Master MCP successfully routing requests
2. **Service Isolation**: Each service in its own container
3. **Monitoring**: Full observability stack deployed
4. **Security**: Secrets management with volume mounts

### Known Issues
1. **Freqtrade MCP**: Incorrect startup command in docker-compose
2. **AI Models MCP**: Import error with fastmcp library
3. **Missing Services**: Services 02-07, 09-10 not implemented
4. **Loki**: Logging aggregator failing to start

## Development Patterns

### Commit Style
- Detailed, descriptive commit messages
- Focus on what changed and why
- Multi-file changes documented comprehensively

### Technology Stack
- **Languages**: Python (primary), with MCP SDK support
- **Containerization**: Docker & Docker Compose
- **Networking**: Docker bridge network (mcp-network)
- **Monitoring**: Prometheus, Grafana, Loki, Promtail
- **Protocols**: MCP over HTTP/SSE, JSON-RPC 2.0

### Service Naming Convention
- Pattern: `NN_servicename_mcp/`
- NN: Two-digit numeric prefix (00-16)
- Ports: 8000 + NN (e.g., 00 = 8000, 15 = 8015)

## Future Roadmap
Based on CLAUDE.md and implementation_roadmap.md:
1. Implement missing web services (highest priority)
2. Add workflow state persistence
3. Implement circuit breaker patterns
4. Add comprehensive caching layer
5. Enhance security with API validation
6. Complete test coverage
